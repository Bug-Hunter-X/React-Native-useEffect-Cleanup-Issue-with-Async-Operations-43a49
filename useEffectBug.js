This error occurs when using the `useEffect` hook in React Native with an asynchronous operation inside.  The problem arises because the cleanup function in `useEffect` might not be called properly when the component unmounts prematurely, causing unexpected behavior or errors. This is especially noticeable if the asynchronous operation (e.g., a `fetch` call) takes a considerable amount of time to complete.
